# TODO: Enable Full Summarization API Functionality

## Current Status
- API is currently returning a test response instead of processing URLs
- OpenAI key is present and configured
- Content extraction and summarization logic is implemented but bypassed

## Tasks
- [x] Remove temporary test response from API route
- [x] Enable URL content extraction and AI summarization
- [x] Test the API with a sample URL to verify functionality
- [ ] Update dashboard UI if needed to handle real responses

## Next Steps
1. Verify summarization works in different formats (bullet-points, flashcards, Q&A)
2. Test with OpenAI API key configured
